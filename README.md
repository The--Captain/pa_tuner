A Klipper gcode macro to quickly calculate correct pressure advance through direct observation of a quick-to-print 1-wall test square.

A measurement is taken of the best quality z-height, and then used in the Pressure Advance formula. The forumla to calculate the Pressure Advance value is dynamically generated from the parameters, and printed as gcode output both before and after the print itself.  If you're not monitoring the output from your printer, you will miss it.  

Add everything from pa_tuner.cfg to your printer.cfg, or just include it with the directive.  Parameters are visible via the HELP command
